    "# SEBIR BESS optimization \n",
    "The purpose of this Python Notebook file is to optimize the parameters of the Swing Equation Based Inertial Response (SEBIR) controller topology for a grid following Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) such that it can mimic the frequency response of a given conventional generator. Each code block in this file represents a key step in the optimization process. All the inputs to this file are entered into the first block of code, so this is the only part of the code that should be modified. Note that a Synchronous Condenser (SC) can be enabled which will replace the inertial response of the BESS. As such, the inertial response of the BESS is disabled if the SC is enabled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters that this file optimizes are:\n",
    "* The droop constant of the frequency controller\n",
    "* The inertia gain of the frequency controller (only if the SC is disabled, otherwise this value is set to 'N/A')\n",
    "* The gain of the PQ controller (which acts as a damping constant)\n",
    "* The integral time constant of the PQ controller (which acts as a damping constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "All other parameters are set to constant values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "The following code block contains all the inputs that the user may want to modify. Note the following:\n",
    "* The information of the generator can be found in the PowerFactory base file and excel results file. \n",
    "* The event information is completely arbitrary, but it should be checked that the base case remains stable, and that the BESS stays within its SOC bounds for whatever event is defined.\n",
    "* The battery pack series cells is also an arbitrary choice, and the default value of 9753 was chosen as it achieves a realistic DC voltage for a battery of this size and results in a parallel cell number that is close to an integer value, so there is negligible inaccuracy due to rounding.\n",
    "* The VSM BESS and synchronous condenser information can be found in the PowerFactory base file and excel results file. \n",
    "* The optimization settings should be tuned to achieve the desired level of accuracy while still converging within a reasonable time frame. Tune the BESS parameters by hand in PowerFactory to be as close as possible to the base case response and choose bounds around the manually tuned values. \n",
    "* There is two simulation end times, one for each stage of the optimization. The simulation end time is initially set to 600s so that it can be ensured that the frequency response has reached steady state (sim_stop_time1). The simulation end time can be shortened to 300s once the Quasi Steady State Frequency (QSSF) has been matched (sim_stop_time2), which reduces computation time.\n",
    "* Setting 'SC_connected' to False will autmatically turn of the SC and enable the inertial response of the BESS. Setting 'SC_connected' to True will autmatically turn on the SC and disable the inertial response of the BESS. "

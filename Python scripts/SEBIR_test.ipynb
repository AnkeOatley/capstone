    "# SEBIR BESS test \n",
    "The purpose of this Python Notebook file is to test if the optimized Swing Equation Based Inertial Response (SEBIR) controller topology for a grid following Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is able to mimic the frequency response of a given conventional generator in a wide range of conditions. Each test is conducted in the IEE 39 Bus System using the corresponding cases (base case and SEBIR case). All of the inputs to this file are entered into the first block of code, so this is the only part of the code that should be modified. The second block sets up the PowerFactory for simulations, and each of the following blocks represents a test case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tests that this file conducts are:\n",
    "* Load 25: 50% step increase in active power consumption. \n",
    "* Load 25: 100% step increase in active power consumption.\n",
    "* Load 08: 50% step increase in active power consumption.\n",
    "* Load 25: 50% step decrease in active power consumption.\n",
    "* Load 25: 100% ramp increase in active power consumption over 60 seconds.\n",
    "* Load 25: 50% step increase in active power consumption, BESS: Change initial SOC from 50% to 60%\n",
    "* Load 25: 50% step increase in active power consumption, AGC: enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All other parameters are set to constant values, including the controller values which are set to the given optimized values. \n",

    "### Inputs\n",
    "The following code block contains all the inputs that the user may want to modify.\n",

It is assumed that the BESS needs to have the same MVA rating as the generator is replacing, so the number of parallel cells needed to achieve this rating can be calculated based on this. This indirectly determines the capacity value of the battery. As the C-rate of these cells is 3C, the capacity will always be 1/3 of the generator rating.

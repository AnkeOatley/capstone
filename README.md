You will find PowerFactory files which were used in optimisation and testing.
The BASE case is the system without any replacements of synchronous generators. This determines the frequency response which we wish to emulate.
The SEBIR BESS includes a SynCon which can be connected or disconnected easily.
The simple system is the 2 bus system which is used in the optimisation. The 39 Bus system uses the modified IEEE 39 Bus system and is used to test how effective the solutions are in a larger network.
G03 is a coal generator and G10 is a hydro generator.
The files labeled (with AGC) include an AGC in which the battery participates.
